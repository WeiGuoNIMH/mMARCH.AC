\title{Relative Amplitude}
\usage{
RA2(x, window = 1, method = c("average", "sum"), noon2noon = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{\code{vector} vector of activity data}

\item{window}{since the caculation of M10 and L5 depends on the dimension of data, we need to include
window size as an argument.}

\item{method}{\code{character} of "sum" or "average", function used to bin the data}

\item{noon2noon}{\code{logical}  Specify if M10 and L5 were calculated from noon to noon. Default is FALSE.}
}
\value{
