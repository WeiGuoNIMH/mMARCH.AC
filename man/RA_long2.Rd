\title{Relative Amplitude for the Whole Datset}
\usage{
RA_long2(
  count.data,
  window = 1,
  method = c("average", "sum"),
  noon2noon = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{count.data}{\code{data.frame} of dimension n * (p+2) containing the
p dimensional activity data for all n subject days.
The first two columns have to be ID and Day. ID can be
either \code{character} or \code{numeric}. Day has to be \code{numeric} indicating
the sequency of days within each subject.}

\item{window}{since the caculation of M10 and L5 depends on the dimension of data, we need to include
window size as an argument. This function is a whole dataset
wrapper for \code{RA}.}

\item{method}{\code{character} of "sum" or "average", function used to bin the data}

\item{noon2noon}{\code{logical}  Specify if M10 and L5 were calculated from noon to noon. Default is FALSE.}
}
\value{
A \code{data.frame} with the following 3 columns
\item{ID}{ID}
\item{Day}{Day}
\item{RA}{RA}
}
\description{
This function calcualte relative amplitude, a nonparametric metric
of circadian rhtymicity. This function is a whole dataset
wrapper for \code{RA}.
